                                                 Email/SMS Spam Classifier

Welcome to the Email Spam Classifier project! This repository contains a machine learning-based solution for detecting spam emails. The classifier is trained to identify spam and non-spam (ham) emails with high accuracy.

**Overview**

The Email Spam Classifier uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques to classify emails as spam or ham. This project is a great starting point for anyone interested in understanding how to build and deploy a text classification model.

**Features**


*High Accuracy: Achieves over 95% accuracy on the test set*

*Real-time Prediction: Capable of classifying emails in real-time.*

*Extensible: Easy to extend with new features or improve with more data.*

*Comprehensive Documentation: Detailed explanations and comments within the codebase.*

**Installation**

*1.Clone the repository:*

   git clone https://github.com/nehagoyal123/email-sms-spam-classifier.git

cd email-spam-classifier

2.Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv

**Dataset**

The dataset used for training the model is the . It contains a mix of spam and ham emails, which have been preprocessed and labeled for training and evaluation purposes.

**Model**

The classifier is built using the following components:

*Text Preprocessing*: Tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

*Machine Learning Model*: A Multinomial Naive Byes classifier trained on the processed text features.

**Results**

The Email Spam Classifier achieves the following performance metrics on the test dataset:

*Accuracy*: 95%

*Precision*: 100%

*Recall*: 96%

*F1-Score*: 95%
